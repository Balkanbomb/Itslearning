* Add Courses to the App
As a student Anna has started attending a new course. In order to get updates from It's learning directly in her phone which she carries with her all the time, she must add it to the app. This is easily done in the global settings for the MaH app, accessed by pressing the settings icon in the toolbar.

* Decide the amount of notifications received
As a student Anna notices that all of her classmates exercises that are turned in are published in the Latest Changes feed. This annoys Anna because each time a student turns in a paper Anna gets a notification on her phone. 

* See the Deadlines of exercises

As student I want to have easy access to services I use and continuous logging in is very annoying. It takes lot of time which doesn't provide me any useful information.

* Choose the amount of Bulletins shown
David, a student is enrolled in multiple courses here in MAH. So, at any given point, he'd recieve updates from all his different courses on ITSL. Preferably, he'd like to limit the number of bulletins he has per page, so that he doesn't get overwhelmed with the number of updates.
